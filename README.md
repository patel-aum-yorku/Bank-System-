Designed a bank system in Java, by implementing advanced OOPs concepts like abstraction and inheritance.
Bank Account is abstract class with two abstract methods ie: deposit and withdraw 
Checking Account inherits bank account class and overrides the abstract methods and also charges some fees when any transactions takes place throught that account.
Saving Account inherits bank account class and overrides the abstract methods and there is function that calculates the interest rate on the balcane and also there is function that adds the interest to balance.
